# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Aug 7, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I have gone through some tutorials on Flutter - CustomPainter widget and experimenting basic shapes in Thayam project to build game-board

**Thoughts** I have been learning Flutter app development for sometime. Now I wanted to build a game app as part of #100daysofcode challenge. The game name is 'Thayam' it's a ludo type game based on South-India.
