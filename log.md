# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Aug 7, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I have gone through some tutorials on Flutter - CustomPainter widget and experimenting basic shapes in Thayam project to build game-board

**Thoughts** I have been learning Flutter app development for sometime. Now I wanted to build a game app as part of #100daysofcode challenge. The game name is 'Thayam' it's a ludo type game based on South-India.

### Day 2: Aug 8, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Calculating positions and building game-board using custompainter widget.

**Thoughts** Went thru many tutorials about CustomPainter - The one from raywenderlich.com was really helpful in understanding custompainter better. The canvas size issue needs to be fixed.

### Day 4: Aug 10, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Adding pawn stage circles and controlling canvas sizing

**Thoughts** Drawing cricles were easy as other squares... and I was trying to control the size of the canvas in many ways but could nt achieve it. However accidently I have changed the parent widget to Stack and the sizing started working automatically ;)

### Day 5: Aug 11, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Trying to add Pawn images on the game-board via canvas.drawImage method.

**Thoughts** I am still struggling to paint the image on the canvas. I could not find any clear online solution on this topic.

### Day 6: Aug 12, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finally drawn the pawn images on the canvas. Did bit of image tweaks in AdobeXD.

**Thoughts** After hours of R&D with image draw finally found a solution which loads the image in async way in the main.dart file itself.

### Day 7: Aug 13, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Refactoring and adding separate pawn class for pawns and to add interactive events

**Thoughts** Need to keep pawn positions in an array and serve from main class. GestureDetector or InkWell to be used for adding tab events.
